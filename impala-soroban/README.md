# Imapala soroban smart contracts

Various impala soroban smart contracts are used to move funds into and out
of a Payala program, in addition to outflows via supported Anchor banking rails.

See the [rs-soroban-sdk](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk) repository
for instructions on installing dependencies and building smart contracts.
